                <h2>Watch Party</h2>
                <p>
                    This app, developed by me and a team of four other people caters to movie lovers.
                    Watch party makes it easier for movie lovers to pick their next movie. Using the youtube and OMDB APIs we
                    were able to create a single page with all the info you need to help pick your next movie. The OMDB API allows us to pull
                    various types of information regaring any movie. Things such as runtime, cast, and descriptions all the way to movie reviews
                    from the most credible movie reviewers. By combining this with the youtube API users can read about a movies description and reviews
                    and watch the trailer, all with one quick search.
